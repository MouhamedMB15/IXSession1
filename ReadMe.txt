Description:

	Throughout this project I developed a personal landing page for my IX Summer upcoming internship. This landing page is developed using HTML and CSS and minor Java Script. 

	This landing page utilizes the design from numerous examples. For instance the utilization of the colors was developed from Color Hunt which follows a dark mode theme. The link can be found here: https://colorhunt.co/palette/22283131363f76abaeeeeeee 

	In addition, this source file contains my resume and my link to my Github account as well as my linkedIn account. A provided snippet of the design of my landing page is also provided. 

Future Updates:

	In the future I would like to utilize React JS to add more animations and functionality to my landing page as well as the addition of all the projects I have completed throughout my CS journey for quick and easy view for other viewers to see. 

	This website is the temporary build and I hope to expand it even further such as dark mode and light mode switch for users. In addition to videos and 3D items. 

Host:

	This website is hosted utilizing GitHub Pages.
